# Participant Management Backend Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the backend implementation for participant management features in the AI Meeting App. The implementation includes new API endpoints, controller functions, and WebSocket events to support real-time participant management.

## New API Endpoints

### Participant Management Routes
- `PUT /api/meetings/:id/participant/:participantId/mute` - Mute/unmute a participant
- `DELETE /api/meetings/:id/participant/:participantId` - Remove a participant from meeting
- `PUT /api/meetings/:id/participant/:participantId/spotlight` - Spotlight a participant
- `PUT /api/meetings/:id/participant/:participantId/hand` - Toggle hand raise status

## Backend Changes

### 1. Meeting Model Updates
Added new fields to the participants schema:
- `isMuted` (Boolean) - Track if participant is muted
- `isVideoOn` (Boolean) - Track if participant's video is on
- `isSpotlighted` (Boolean) - Track if participant is spotlighted
- `handRaised` (Boolean) - Track if participant has raised their hand

### 2. Meeting Controller Functions
Added new controller functions:
- `muteParticipant` - Handle muting/unmuting participants
- `removeParticipant` - Handle removing participants from meetings
- `spotlightParticipant` - Handle spotlighting participants
- `toggleHandRaise` - Handle toggling hand raise status

### 3. WebSocket Events
Added new WebSocket events for real-time communication:
- `participant-muted` - Notify when participant is muted/unmuted
- `participant-video-changed` - Notify when participant video status changes
- `participant-hand-raised` - Notify when participant raises/lowers hand
- `participant-removed` - Notify when participant is removed
- `participant-spotlighted` - Notify when participant is spotlighted

## Security Considerations
- Only hosts and moderators can mute/remove/spotlight participants
- Only the participant themselves, host, or moderator can raise/lower hand
- Host cannot be removed from their own meeting
- All actions require proper authentication

## Frontend Integration
The frontend components have been updated to:
- Call the new backend APIs for participant management
- Handle real-time WebSocket events
- Update UI state in real-time
- Provide proper user feedback

## Testing
All new functionality has been tested to ensure:
- Proper authorization checks
- Real-time updates across participants
- Error handling for edge cases
- Data consistency between frontend and backend

This implementation provides a complete participant management system that allows hosts to effectively manage meeting participants while maintaining security and real-time synchronization.
