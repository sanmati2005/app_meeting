# Participant Management Guide

## How Participants Join Meetings

### 1. Getting the Meeting Invitation
Participants can join meetings in two ways:
1. **Direct Invitation**: Host shares the meeting link directly
2. **Scheduled Meetings**: Participants access scheduled meetings through the app

### 2. Joining a Meeting
1. Click on the meeting link or navigate to the Meetings page
2. Click the "Join" button for the desired meeting
3. Grant camera and microphone permissions when prompted
4. You'll be connected to the meeting room

### 3. Meeting Room Features
Once in the meeting, participants can:
- Toggle audio on/off with the microphone button
- Toggle video on/off with the camera button
- Share their screen using the "Share Screen" button
- View participant list by clicking the "Participants" button
- Raise their hand to get attention
- Access chat (if enabled by host)

## Host Participant Management

### 1. Host Controls
As the meeting host, you have additional controls:
- **Mute/Unmute All**: Mute or unmute all participants at once
- **Start/Stop Recording**: Record the meeting session
- **Security Settings**: Control meeting access and participant permissions
- **End Meeting**: End the meeting for all participants

### 2. Managing Individual Participants
From the participant list, hosts can:
- Mute/unmute specific participants
- Turn on/off video for specific participants
- Spotlight a participant (make their video prominent)
- Remove participants from the meeting
- Promote participants to moderator role

### 3. Security Features
Hosts can control meeting security through:
- **Waiting Room**: Participants wait for approval before joining
- **Passcode Protection**: Require a passcode to join
- **Mute on Entry**: Automatically mute participants when they join
- **Lock Meeting**: Prevent additional participants from joining
- **Disable Chat/Video**: Restrict participant capabilities

## Best Practices

### For Participants
1. Test your camera and microphone before joining
2. Join with headphones to prevent echo
3. Mute when not speaking to reduce background noise
4. Use the "Raise Hand" feature instead of interrupting
5. Ensure good lighting for video

### For Hosts
1. Enable waiting room for larger meetings
2. Mute participants on entry for formal meetings
3. Monitor participant list and remove disruptive users
4. Share the meeting link only with intended participants
5. Lock the meeting once all expected participants have joined

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Can't Join Meeting**:
   - Verify the meeting link is correct
   - Check that the meeting hasn't ended
   - Ensure you have the correct passcode (if required)

2. **Audio/Video Not Working**:
   - Check browser permissions
   - Ensure no other apps are using camera/microphone
   - Try refreshing the page

3. **Participant Can't Be Heard**:
   - Ask them to check if they're muted
   - Suggest they use headphones
   - Check if noise suppression is affecting their audio

4. **Video Quality Issues**:
   - Ask participant to turn off video if quality is poor
   - Suggest closing other bandwidth-intensive applications
   - Check your own internet connection
